An automatically-implemented extension trait on [`RngCore`] providing high-level\n generic methods for sampling values and other convenience methods.\n \n This is the primary trait to use when generating random values.\n \n # Generic usage\n \n The basic pattern is `fn foo<R: Rng + ?Sized>(rng: &mut R)`. Some\n things are worth noting here:\n \n - Since `Rng: RngCore` and every `RngCore` implements `Rng`, it makes no\n   difference whether we use `R: Rng` or `R: RngCore`.\n - The `+ ?Sized` un-bounding allows functions to be called directly on\n   type-erased references; i.e. `foo(r)` where `r: &mut RngCore`. Without\n   this it would be necessary to write `foo(&mut r)`.\n \n An alternative pattern is possible: `fn foo<R: Rng>(rng: R)`. This has some\n trade-offs. It allows the argument to be consumed directly without a `&mut`\n (which is how `from_rng(thread_rng())` works); also it still works directly\n on references (including type-erased references). Unfortunately within the\n function `foo` it is not known whether `rng` is a reference type or not,\n hence many uses of `rng` require an extra reference, either explicitly\n (`distr.sample(&mut rng)`) or implicitly (`rng.gen()`); one may hope the\n optimiser can remove redundant references later.\n \n Example:\n \n ```\n # use rand::thread_rng;\n use rand::Rng;\n \n fn foo<R: Rng + ?Sized>(rng: &mut R) -> f32 {\n     rng.gen()\n
